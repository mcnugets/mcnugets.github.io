                                    In machine learning, throughout the years the architecture of neural networks has
                                    been
                                    under
                                    rigorous observation and has been developed constantly. However, when it comes to
                                    the
                                    complexity of the data and the structure of layers within the network our best
                                    strategy
                                    is
                                    to
                                    come up with the best architecture so that when we use the network for any
                                    reoccurring
                                    problem, heavy computational consumption can be avoided. Hence pruning is proposed
                                    by
                                    many papers that explore the field of pruning on how to find an effective subnetwork
                                    that
                                    has
                                    just as much efficiency as the original network. Furthermore, there are many
                                    optimization
                                    techniques besides pruning, one of which is dimensional reduction, which is a
                                    projection
                                    of
                                    multivariate data into a lower dimension, for effectivity purposes. In this paper,
                                    we
                                    propose
                                    dimensional reduction methods like Principal component analysis(PCA), Independent
                                    Component Analysis(ICA), and Isometric mapping(Isomap), and utilize these methods
                                    for
                                    weight matrices decomposition within the pre-trained network that were trained using
                                    datasets
                                    like CIFAR10, and MNIST. We use those methods in two scenarios: one is where the
                                    network
                                    is unpruned, and two where we prune the network and then apply dimensionality
                                    reduction
                                    afterwards. Moreover, we develop a technique that combines dimensional reduction and
                                    matrix
                                    transformation that helps us to preserve as much information as possible. We believe
                                    that
                                    this
                                    experiment provides interesting results with some potential.

                                    The project focused on the use of dimensional reduction techniques and applying them
                                    to
                                    the
                                    pruned
                                    convolutional neural network.
                                    This aims to achieve an improved optimization via extracting the sparse weight
                                    matrices(after
                                    pruning) of a particular network,
                                    hence solving the problem of network size and computation time. As opposed to
                                    training a
                                    relatively
                                    smaller network, the goal is
                                    to avoid unnecessary computations and preserve as much information as possible after
                                    performing
                                    dimensional reduction. This project performed
                                    such experiments on custom-made convolutional neural networks using open-source
                                    datasets:
                                    CIFAR10
                                    and MNIST. Moreover, the testing was conducted
                                    using linear and non-linear dimensional reduction techniques, thus to evaluate their
                                    potential.
                                    The
                                    methods are PCA, ICA, Isomap, NMF, and MDS.
                                    Based on my personal analysis, Isomap performs poorly on complex datasets like
                                    CIFAR10,
                                    hence I
                                    used
                                    MNIST for this case. Hypotherically it can be assumed that after pruning has been
                                    completed,
                                    weight matrices achieve a sparse state. Based on this we can ask ourselves if we can
                                    reduce
                                    such
                                    matrix dimensions by minimizing or eliminating elements with the value of 0, and
                                    this is
                                    where
                                    we
                                    utilize dimensional reduction.
                                    Three last fully-connected layers of the custom-made network were used for weight
                                    extraction.
                                    Once
                                    weight matrix decomposition is completed, the idea was to adapt a new derived matrix
                                    to
                                    the
                                    relevant
                                    network.
